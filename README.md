## Description
Not enough Crypto/Blockchain apps have an adequate alert system that allows users to set alerts for different cryptocurrencies when a price per coin hits above or below a certain price. 

This app will allow users to save various cryptocurrencies to their profile so that they can watch the price per coin fluctuate in real time, as well as set price alerts to receive notifications (either by email or on-screen) whenever a cryptocurrency drops below or rises above a certain price per coin set by the user. 

This will help users monitor the crypto market & know when the big "dip" may occur.
