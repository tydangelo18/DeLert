# bol

## Description

Bowlers need an adequate way to track their bowling game improvement, other than just tracking their score trends over time. 

Sometimes when bowlers stay within a consistent range of scores (i.e hit a Plateau), they struggle to overcome it because they aren't focusing on what is causing them to stay within the plateau. Bowlers need to dig deeper into their game by tracking how many strikes and spares per game they are getting, and how many frames they are leaving open (pins left standing after the frame is over). 

Once a bowler can see these metrics, they can take a step back and get a better understanding of what they need to work on to improve their game. 

bol will allow users to create and sign into their personal account, input their scores, number of strikes per game, spares per game, and open frames per game over a period of time, save them to the database, and return different metrics generated from the inputs. 

These metrics will include, but are not limited to:
    1. Average Score
    2. Average Strikes per game
    3. Average Spares per game
    4. Average Frames Open per game
    5. Increases and decreases (average and percentage) in strikes, spares, and open frames from game-to-game, day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, or year-to-year. 

User will also be able to generate charts and graphs for these metrics if they prefer visuals.
